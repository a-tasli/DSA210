# Investigating a Possible Correlation Between Daily Reported Mood and Dates of Academic Significance

In this project, I will investigate if there is a correlation between my daily reported mood, and dates of academic importance (i.e. exams, quizzes, labs, homework submissions, etc.)

The datasets I will be working with is a record of my self-reported mood taken every day, and dates of academic importance taken from SUCourse or in-class announcements.

The reported mood is a simple scale from 1-6, where 1 is the worst mood and 6 is the best. This is reported every day between 22:00 and 00:00 of the next day.

The average of daily reported mood in a certain number of days leading up to a date of academic significance will be compared to the average of daily reported mood in other days will be compared to find evidence of a monotonic relationship using Spearman Correlation.

This will be done in Python using libraries such as numpy, scipy and pandas.
