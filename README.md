# DSA210

In this project, I will investigate if there is a correlation between my reported daily mood, and dates of academic importance (i.e. exams, quizzes, labs, homework submissions, etc.)

The datasets i will be working with is a record of my self-reported daily mood taken every day once from 22:00 to 00:00 of the next day, and dates of exams
